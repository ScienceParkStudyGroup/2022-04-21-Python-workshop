<p>
This workshop is organized by the <a href="https://uba.uva.nl/en/home">Data Science Center (part of the UvA of Amsterdam Library)</a> and by members of the <a href="https://www.scienceparkstudygroup.info/">Amsterdam Science Park Study Group</a>. These two communities aim to promote skill sharing and collaboration through the organisation of interactive workshops in scientific programming. They act as the main local hubs to set-up Software and Data Carpentry workshops (official workshops and Carpentry-style). All are welcome, regardless of scientific research area, affiliation or training level.
